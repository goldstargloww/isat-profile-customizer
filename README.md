###Update
I'm working on an ISAT dialogue maker right now but the project is on hold because I got burnout for a bit. Feel free to request features by pinging me in the ISAT server (@kongkrog).

You can run the page directly using this link: https://kongkrog.github.io/isat-profile-customizer/render.html

HTML App for customizing ISAT profile.
New: Now with customizing the Party Member menu!

### Usage
Please use the link above to avoid downloading this repo.
Else download this repo and run the html file for usage.

### Notes
If you want to improve/modify this project, feel free to clone/fork it. My code is sloppy and I already lost my will to fix it.

### Details
Just finished this project in 7 hours. Doesn't support mobile since I'm too lazy to do so.
It also doesn't auto-save because that would involve local saving andddd I'm also too lazy (and busy) for do that.

There's no built-in recording stuff so please use your own recording software if you want to.
The image input does support .gif files so.... go wild with it.
