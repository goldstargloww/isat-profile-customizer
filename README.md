### Notes
If you want to improve/modify this project, feel free to clone/fork it. My code is sloppy and I already lost my will to fix it.

### Details
Doesn't support mobile since I'm too lazy to do so.
It also doesn't auto-save because that would involve local saving andddd I'm also too lazy (and busy) for do that.

There's no built-in recording stuff so please use your own recording software if you want to.
The image input does support .gif files so.... go wild with it.
