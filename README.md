HTML App for customizing ISAT profile.

### Usage
Download this repo and run the html file for usage.

### Details
Just finished this project in 7 hours. Doesn't support mobile since I'm too lazy to do so.
It also doesn't auto-save because that would involve local saving andddd I'm also too lazy (and busy) for do that.

There's no built-in recording stuff so please use your own recording software if you want to.
The input for image does support gif files so, go wild with it.

### Addition
Fork this repo if you want to. My code is sloppy as crab and I lost my willpower to fix it.
